### Q1

Question 1 required us to visualize the readings from a sensor. We used UART to send the values from a photoresistor to the computer, 
and we plotted the values from the UART terminal using Excel.

We tested that the photoresistor's resistance varies from around 2 kΩ to around 50 kΩ, and decided on a resistor value of 16 kΩ for our voltage divider. 
We connected the output of the voltage divider to pin P1.7, aka analog pin A7.
